# VBA Homework: The VBA of Wall Street

## Purpose

This project summarizes stock data for all sheets in a workbook in order to provide more easy analysis. 

### Project Details

1.  Data is summarized by Ticker for the following:  Yearly Change, Percent Change, and Total Stock 
Volume.  All net positive changes for the year are indicated in green. Negative changes for the year
are indicated in green.  If there is no change, the cell color is unchanged.

2.  Further summary is provided in the Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease, and Greatest
Total Volume columns.  This is an even greater summary of the new values calculated in #1.  

### Files

* Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm (data set used in this example)
* Stock Market code.txt  (run this VB script to process data as described above)
* Screen Shots for Excel 2018-2020 data (3) (screenshots of the three sheets after script was run)

### Stock Market Analyst

This summary data provides a good overview for what is occurring with the stocks.  The data is
too large to gather this information just by looking at the raw data.  The script processes all 
sheets within the workbook to make the process even more efficient.
